# Corona_Project
Solution to Project given as internal Bagrut on 2020 for students who chose to do so instead of taking the external one.
Due to Coronavirus outbreak, 11th grade students that were majoring 2 scientific subjects (Physics, Chimestry, Biology, Computer Science), were given the option to get one final bagrut exam ond in the other they had to take internal grade as their final grade.
Students that chose to have internal grade in Computer science recived this assignments as an replacement to the exam planned to have. The assignment has 2 parts:

Part 1: 60% of the grade - were tested by the script written in the file TestTheAssignment.cs. In other word ducument I will explain how this code works (in Hebrew)
Part 2: 40% grade - testing the student in person (online - via Zoom) in which the student has to explain and answer questions regarding their code.

The project also includes my solution to the project.

Here is the message (also written in TestTheAssignment.cs) for the student about my script of testing

the correction of each task according to the
